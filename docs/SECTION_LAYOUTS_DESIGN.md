## Implementation Notes

### Content Editability
All layouts maintain the same editable content:
- **Images**: Can be swapped/replaced via ImageLibrary
- **Text**: All text should be editable (title, description, paragraphs)
- **Buttons**: Button text and actions remain editable
- **Stats**: Stat values, labels, and descriptions should be editable

### Layout Selection
- Layouts are stored in `section_layouts` table with `layout_type` field
- Values: `'layout-1'`, `'layout-2'`, `'layout-3'` (or `'default'` for layout-1)
- Layout selection happens in Visual Editor via LayoutPreview component

### CSS Classes
Each layout should use BEM naming:
- Base: `{section}--layout-1`, `{section}--layout-2`, `{section}--layout-3`
- Example: `hero--layout-1`, `mission--layout-2`, `story--layout-3`

### Responsive Design
All layouts must be responsive:
- Desktop: Full layout as described
- Tablet: Adjusted grid columns (may stack)
- Mobile: Single column, stacked elements
